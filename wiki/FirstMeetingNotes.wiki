#summary Proposed microprocessor layout for control/feedback and other notes from the initial meeting.

= Proposed microprocessor layout for control/feedback =

On Saturday Feb 17 2007 we met to discuss various issues for the design of this helicopter.


= Details =

We decided a good approach is to use a central CPU (possibly [http://www.toradex.com/e/Factsheet_Colibri_Intel_Marvell_XScale_PXA_Computer_Modules.php#Colibri_PXA320 this] Intel PXA module) for the high level processing, and several low end PICs for specialized tasks.

Jobs done by the main CPU:
  * Communication with base station
  * assigning tasks to the specialized MCUs
  * non-flight control sensing: battery level, GPS, etc.
  * photography
  * collision detection

Specialized MCUs (12fxx or 16fxx PIC):
  * Pitch/Roll MCU
    * Controls 2 servos connected to main rotor
    * requires feedback from gyroscopes, level sensor
  * Yaw MCU
    * Controls servo connected to rear rotor
    * requires feedback from compass, gyroscope
  * Motor Control / Elevation MCU
    * Controls motor power
    * requires feedback from GPS, elevation sensors, possibly motor RPM
  * Base Station MCU
    * A radio to Laptop bridge
