#summary A possible RF module to be used

= Introduction =
One idea for a radio system is to use the Easy Radio ERx00TRS-02 Transceiver. 


= Details =
The ERx00TRS-02 has the following characteristics:
  * Half Duplex operation (RX and TX but not simultaneously)
  * Customizable Serial I/O baud rate (deigned to interface with uC UARTS
  * CMOS/TTL logic levels
  * 180 byte TX/RX Buffer
  * Modules available in 400MHz and 900Mhz ranges
  * Includes software for programming the module

I personally believe this is a suitable module to use. It will significantly reduce design time, and allow us to focus more on making the helicopter actually fly.

This radio module has a maximum data throughput of 38.4kbps (see page 14 of the datasheet).  This is plenty for telemetry data, but too slow for video or photos.

Another option to look at are Zigbee modules like [http://www.maxstream.net/products/xbee/xbee-oem-rf-module-zigbee.php this one].  It can transmit 250kbps, still not super fast, but faster.
