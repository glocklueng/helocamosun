#summary Possible RF modules to be used


= Easy Radio ERx00TRS-02 Transceiver. =

The ERx00TRS-02 has the following characteristics:
  * Half Duplex operation (RX and TX but not simultaneously)
  * Customizable Serial I/O baud rate (deigned to interface with uC UARTS
  * CMOS/TTL logic levels
  * 180 byte TX/RX Buffer
  * Modules available in 400MHz and 900Mhz ranges
  * Includes software for programming the module

Pros:
  * It will significantly reduce design time, and allow us to focus more on making the helicopter actually fly.

Cons:
  * This radio module has a maximum data throughput of 38.4kbps (see page 14 of the datasheet).  This is plenty for telemetry data, but too slow for video or photos.

= XBee-PROâ„¢ ZigBee OEM RF Module =

Characteristics:
  * 60 mW (18 dBm), 100 mW EIRP power output (up to 1 mile range) 
  * 250kbps RF data rate, up to 115.2kbps interface data rate
  * serial data interface: 3V CMOS UART - No configuration required

Pros:
  * Good range
  * fairly inexpensive ($32.00 usd)
  * off the shelf USB reciever available

Cons:
  * probably more difficult to set up than the Easy Radio module
