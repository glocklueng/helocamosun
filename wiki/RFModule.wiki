#summary A possible RF module to be used

= Introduction =
One idea for a radio system is to use the Easy Radio ERx00TRS-02 Transceiver. 


= Details =
The ERx00TRS-02 has the following characteristics:
  * Half Duplex operation (RX and TX but not simultaneously)
  * Customizable Serial I/O baud rate (deigned to interface with uC UARTS
  * CMOS/TTL logic levels
  * 180 byte TX/RX Buffer
  * Modules available in 400MHz and 900Mhz ranges
  * Includes software for programming the module

I personally believe this is a suitable module to use. It will significantly reduce design time, and allow us to focus more on making the helicopter actually fly.
