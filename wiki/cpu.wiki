#summary Discussion of the hardware used for upper control functions of the helicopter

A CPU is required for the upper functions of the helicopter.  These functions are as follows.

  * Implementation of our custom communication protocol (to be defined)
  * GPS data parsing
  * monitoring of non-stability related helicopter functions (battery, GPS etc)
  * assigning tasks to the stability MCUs (eg. go to waypoint, ascend, descend)
  * photography/video
  * collision detection

We will likely use an operating system such as Linux, QNX or another RTOS variant.  A Realtime OS may not be necessary, since the stability MCUs will handle critical helicopter functions in real time. So far we have considered the following modules:
