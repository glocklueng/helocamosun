# Easy Radio ERx00TRS-02 Transceiver. #

The ERx00TRS-02 has the following characteristics:
  * Half Duplex operation (RX and TX but not simultaneously)
  * Customizable Serial I/O baud rate (deigned to interface with uC UARTS
  * CMOS/TTL logic levels
  * 180 byte TX/RX Buffer
  * Modules available in 400MHz and 900Mhz ranges
  * Includes software for programming the module

Pros:
  * It will significantly reduce design time, and allow us to focus more on making the helicopter actually fly.

Cons:
  * This radio module has a maximum data throughput of 38.4kbps (see page 14 of the datasheet).  This is plenty for telemetry data, but too slow for video or photos.
