<p><h1>About</h1></p>
<hr />
<p>Team Heli Cam Ltd intends to &quot;wow&quot; the demonstration audience with the greatest of man's inventions - powered flight. The idea is to modify an RC helicopter (the type hobbyists fly on the weekend) with a computer and electronic sensors. The sensors will detect the helicopter's orientation and provide the computer with this information. The computer will then make decisions based on this information using a system called &quot;Fuzzy Logic Control&quot; and adjust the flight surfaces of the helicopter to maintain or alter the helicopter's attitude appropriately.</p>
<p>The operator of the system will have a PC loaded with the Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed for the helicopter installed. The operator can then instruct the helicopter to perform various flight operations. For instance the operator can order the helicopter to proceed to a location described by a latitude and longitude and the helicopter will use GPS navigation to proceed to that location. </p>
