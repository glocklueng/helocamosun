<p class="style2">Biography:  Carl was born in Campbell River BC and was raised in Black Creek BC.  In high school he was involved in many shop programs;  among which were metal working, and electronics.</p>
<p class="style2">After high school, he completed the Electronics Technician Common Core program at North Island College and entered the work force as an electronics technician.  This work was not challenging and resulted in a need for further understanding of the nature of electronic systems.  </p>
<p class="style2">In the summer of 2004, he started his studies at Camosun College in the Electronics Engineering Technology program.    </p>
<p class="style2">Apart from school, his time is spent rock climbing (indoor and outdoor),  weight lifting, playing baseball, and riding his motorcycle.      </p>
<p class="style2">In the future, he plans on bridging to UVic to get a degree in Electrical Engineering and then to pursue a masters degree in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Calgary, Dalhousie University, or the University of Washington. </p>
